# SolarClient Directions.
 --------------------------------------------------
1. Before you put the mods into your minecraft
you will need forge 1.8.9:
https://files.minecraftforge.net/

2. Go to your .minecraft or Minecraft folder:
Mac: Go to Finder then press Ctrl + Shift + G on your keyboard. Go to Application Support then Minecraft.
Windows: Win Key + R Then Enter %appdata%, then click .minecraft

3. Drag the mods (from the Mods Folder) into your Mods folder once you've installed forge. 

4. If you want my ingame settings drag the .cfg files into the config folder (in .minecraft or minecraft folder).

5. Then put the, "cheatbreakercps.settings, cheatbreakerfps.settings, cheatbreakerkeysrokes.settings, coordsmod.settings, and custom-crosshair-mod_save.txt" into your .minecraft folder or minecraft folder.

6. Launch Minecraft and enjoy.
